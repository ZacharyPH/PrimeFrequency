# PrimeFrequency
A recent 3Brown1Blue lock down math session said that prime frequency surrounding a number is close to it's natural log. I'm checking that.
##### Work plan:
- [x] Get primes (https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/millions/) (requests)
- [ ] Unzip primes (zipfile.ZipFile)
- [ ] Store in appropriate data structure (np array? list?)
- [ ] Generate cumulative count list (np array? list?)
- [ ] Plot ln(x) (numpy)
- [ ] Plot counts, experiment with bucket size (numpy)
